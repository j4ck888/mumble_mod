Mumble is an Open Source, low-latency and high-quality voice-chat program
written on top of Qt and Opus.

There are two modules in Mumble; the client (mumble) and the server (murmur).
The client works on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and macOS,
while the server should work on anything Qt can be installed on.

Please note that with "Windows" we mean 7 and newer.
Vista may be supported, but we can't guarantee it.
If you don't want to encounter potential issues, you may download Mumble 1.3.x,
the last version to provide support for XP.
